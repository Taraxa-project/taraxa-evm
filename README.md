# Go Ethereum EVM

## Building the source

Building requires both a Go (version 1.9 or later) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run

    make evm

or

    make all

The exexutable named `evm` will appear in the `build/bin` directory.
